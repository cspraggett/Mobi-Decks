James' Notes

I've tried to refactor common elements of these socket javascript files
but was unsuccessful and time's short until the deadline.
I'll revisit again to try factor them out at later date.

socket-goof.js was the first one to be completed and others should be
following it's guidelines. Portions regard saving user_id, room_id, socket.id
data(ones with numbered *perhaps outdated* comments) should be
mostly identical across the pages.

The above gathered data is saved in db gameData.js. It is mostly empty
looking at first look, but socket-$(game).js is written to insert
data as players join games and delete them as they leave. The data has
been exported to new page so that it may be accessed by multiple files
if necessary.

routing to and away from client ejs pages are combined effort of these
socket-$(game).js files and respective js files in routes(folder above).
There are some degree of double checks between pairs of them
to eliminate false tracking, and so far it's been mostly accurate,
but there still can be leaks which I haven't found out.

Current Goals
(project requirements)
- implement at least 1 more game
- push result of each games to database
- complete leaderboard & archive based on those data
- create new tabs when a player attempts to join new game
- add active games for given player to drop-down list

(lessor priorities)
- allow game to stay when someone disconnect,
  resume when the player returns
- smooth out game start rather than abrupt start as
  another player join

Debugging players joining and leaving socket rooms:
- place following code at the end of entering and leaving room part
  to see who is in which room at given time

  console.log('*-connected----------------------');
  console.log('*-object keys io.nsps------------');
  console.log(Object.keys(io.nsps));
  console.log('*-all rooms----------------------');
  console.log(Object.keys(io.nsps['/goof'].adapter.rooms));
  console.log('*-goofServer rooms---------------');
  console.log(goofServer.rooms);
  console.log('*-goofServer players-------------');
  console.log(goofServer.players);
  console.log('--------------------------------*');
  console.log('');
